#Interacting with Data
An interactive visualizations of 20 years of Games using **Angular.js(Ionic Framework)** , **Python Flask** , **plot.ly** & **C3.js**.
## CODE
You can find the code for both the Ionic & Python at my github repository [yaswanthsvist](https://github.com/yaswanthsvist/ign-kaggle)

##Setup
You need to [create](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) a ionic app and replace the www dirctory with ign-kaggle/UI/www directory.


I am skipping the Python setup.

run pd_sample.py for apis.

##Visualizing Data
I have used C3.js for visualizing the pie and bar charts.
Plot.ly for visualizing the Heatmap.
I will try NVD3.js for other kaggle datasets. 

##Interacting with Platforms
Below is a sample example of interacting with platforms pie chart and showing insights of **PC** & **Play station2**  platforms.

From above we can say **PC** Platform has the highest share among all players in the market.
**Strategy** games are the dominating genre in PC Platform.

##Birth of Platforms:
I have made a  platforms vs Birth year("the year in which the first game released in the platform") chart using **Plot.ly** Heatmap.
Using this heatmap one can zoom perticular area of heat map.
below show's a heatmap with 59 platforms vs birth year.
